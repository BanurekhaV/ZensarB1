Cursors : Storage Locations that can store the resultsets/recordsets
          It allows to retrieve each row at a time.
          To manipulate the data-update,perform calculations
	  It is a pointer to a row

2 types: Implicit and Explicit


Life Cycle of an explicit cursor:
 1. Declare a cursor
 2. Open the cursor
 3. Fetch the records
 4. Iterate the recordset
     point 3 n 4 will be iterating till end of cursor
 5. Close the cursor
 6. Deallocate the cursor

Explicit Cursors : 1. Forward only : Fastest cursor. Moves only in the forward direction. No scrolling. Can perform DML operations

2. Static cursors : The data is static and read only. Allows back and forth movements. It is slow. Consumes more memory

3. Dynamic curosrs : Allows DML Operations. Scrollable. All changes can be seen inside the cursor

4. Keyset Cursors:Is in between a static and dynamic 

Limitation sof Cursor: Memory consumption is high
                       Network resources usage for fetching data
                       It imposes lock on the resources
                       performance will be slow
