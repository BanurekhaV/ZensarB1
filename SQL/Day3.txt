list all the employees who earn more than hemanth

1. find the salary of hemanth

select salary from employee where empname ='hemanth'
   8000
select empname,salary from employee where salary > 8000

subquery - query within a query

select empname,salary from employee where salary >
             (select salary from employee where empname =(

                    select empname from employee where empid=105))

Guideines for subquery : Enclose subqueries within parenthesis
                         Place the subquery on the right hand side of the comparision condition
                         Use single-row operators with single-row subquery and multi-row operatoes for multi-row subquery

Operators for 
 single-row subquery (<,>,<=,>=,!=,<>,=)
 multi-row subquery (in,any,all)

select salary from employee where salary in(
			select salary from employee where deptid=2)

Corelated subquery: where the inner query is dependent on the outer query for input

diff. between nested subquery and corelated subquery:

Nested: the inner query executes once, and returns the output to the main query.
Corelated: for every row of the outer query, the inner query executes once


File Groups: SQL server database has 3 types of files viz. Primary, Secondary, Transaction Log

Primary File Group : Default group, which stores all data centric info.(.mdf) Startup information, and also pointers to other files

User Defined/Secondary : All user defined files having extension .ndf

Trn Log File : There has to be atleast one log file, which can log all the transactions. Is used to recover database info. in case of crash. The extension is .ldf

alter database Zensardb
add file
(
NAME='Orders',
FILENAME='E:\Orders_file.ndf',
SIZE=10MB,
MAXSIZE=100MB,
FILEGROWTH =3%

)
To Filegroup OrdersData

create table customerOrder
(
col1, datatype zise constraints,
col2 ...

)
on OrdersData

Text/NText = 2^31 -1

Whenever we create a primary key for a table, an unique clustered index gets created (this index is the one that ensures uniqueness)

Indexes are of 2 types 1. Clustered (a table can have only one clustered index)
  2. Non-Clustered ( a table can have many non clustered indexes)
