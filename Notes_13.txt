IComparable: Sort method know how to sort inbuilt collections, but what if we want to sort user defined types.
-can be used as long as we have control of the user-defined classes.
-If we wish to sort the object which is not accessible to you(some external references viz. dll), which can be accessed, but cant change the implementation. Then we can use Icomparer

IComparer: has a method called Compare(Takes 2 objects as arguments).

Name of Operator:This can produce the names of variables, type, members as string constants

Iterators: Are used to retrieve elements from the collection. They can be used as a method or property. They cannot be used in events,static constructor.It cannot contain ref or out parameters.
We can use yield statements either with return or break keywords, which has special meaning attached to yield.


Ref Local and Ref Returns:
RefLocal:Is  a new variable type that is used to store the reference
-It is used in conjunction with ref returns to store reference in a local variable
-Local variables now, can also be declared with the ref modifier


pattern Matching: Object pattern matching with switch, if and when clauses

DotNet Remoting: Is a mechanism for communicating between objects that are not in the same process

COM-DCOM (marshalling - unmarshalling)

- A framework that provides interaction between objects across applications and networks.
It hides the most difficult aspects of communication like connections,marshalling data,reading, writing xml, SOAP(Simpe Object Access Protocol) data

An object that is going to be a remote object is to be derived from MarshalByRefObject class or serialize the data using[Serializable]
When a client activates a remote object, it receives a proxy to the remote object.

Types of.net remotable objects:

single call: Object per client
singleton: Object for all client
