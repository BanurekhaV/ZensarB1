Collections : Set of data that make up a collection datatype
-Dynamic (resizable)
-Different datatypes

ArrayList                        List
Hash Tables                      Dictionary
Stacks  - Last in First Out
Queues  - Fisrt in First Out
Sorted List

Arrayist : is a combination of Array and List
           can have any datatypes as elements
           is identified with an index position
           arraylist with diffrent datatypes cannot be sorted.
 
Hashtable: is a collection that stores data with a key value pair
           Uses hashing technique to sort the keys
           It does not use the inserted order or the sorted order
           Keys have to be unique(cannot be duplicated)
           Keys cannot be null
           is used to search large data collections with huge records
          
Generics:Organizes and retrieves data effectively without compromising the type safety.
It give better performance 

Eg:List<T>
T refers- Templated classes,methods,fields,properties etc.
