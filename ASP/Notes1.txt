In other word viewstate variables can retain data/values only of the current page

Application Events:

  Session_End

Statement Management : Capacity to retain the state of the Page(values of the various controls on the page)

Types of State Management:

1. Client Techniques
   a) ViewState : Is a just a variable, so no load on ther server/system
   b) Hidden fields: Is a class. So every time we call, it has to be instantiated, and all members to be initialized. More load on the system/server
-both viewstate as well as hidden fields are local to the form/page
   c) Cookies :When you want the data to travel between pages
 are of 2 types : Peristant cookies and non Persistant cookies

Persistant Cookies : will make use of a class called HttpCookies, which is a sealed class

   d) Query Strings: are data that are passed along with the url using ?. Since they are visible on the address bar, sensitive data cannot be sent as a query string

2. Server Techniques
   a) Session state
   b) Application state

enable the trace to true under <system.web> of the web.config file.
trace.axd file gets created with which we will be able to track all requests/response in the form of get/post etc
