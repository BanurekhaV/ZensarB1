-Write a method called displayresult, which should calculate the average marks
-If marks of any one subject is less than 35 print result as failed
-If marks of all subject is >35 but average is < 50 then also print result as failed
-If avg > 50 then print result as passed.

3.Create an Abstract class Student with  Name, StudentId, Grade as members and also an abstract method Boolean Ispassed(grade) which takes grade as an input and checks whether student passed the course or not.  

Create 2 Sub classes Undergraduate and Graduate that inherits all members of the student and overrides Ispassed() method 

For the UnderGrad class, if the grade is above 70.0, then isPassed returns true, otherwise it returns false. For the Grad class, if the grade is above 80.0, then isPassed returns true, otherwise returns false.
