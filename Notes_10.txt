Inline Function : A piece of code that can be executed as apart of some other function/statements without having to create a s seperate function and make calls to it.

Anonymous Methods/Functions : A function that does not have any name to it.
We can make use of annymous methods through delegates

Generic Delegates:
Delegates as Parameter to methods

Event - Publishers - Subscribers
-Events enable a class or object to notify other classes when something occurs/changes etc
-The class that raises the event is publisher
-The class that handles the event is subscriber
-Publisher determines when an event is raised
-Events can have multiple subscribers
-Subscribers can handle events from multiple publishers

Publisher is an object that contains the definition of the event and the delegate. The event-delegate association is also defined in this object. A publisher object invokes the event and it is notified to other objects

A subscriber is an object that accepts the event and provides an event handler. The delegate in the publisher class invokes the method(event handler) of the subscriber class.

//user-->event-->delegate-->function

Files: IO
Serialization: is  a process of converting object into byte streams so that we can save the data to a file or database. The reverse is called as Deserialization.
