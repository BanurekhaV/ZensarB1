AutoProperty Initializers

HashCode: 
-GetType() gets te type of the object. GetHashCode() returns the hash code for the current Type. It is a numeric value which is used to identify an object in the hash-based collection. 
-Hash codes helps to do quick equality checks
--Note: Two objects that return different hash codes, mean that the objects are not equal. The reverse is not true(Equal hash codes does not imply that the objects are same. 
-Unequal objects can have identical hash codes.
-Do not test for equality of hash codes to determine two objects are equal. 


Object Pooling:
  Shallow and Deep Copy

Is vs As
	Is								As
is used to check if the runtime type of an 			It is used to perform conversion between compatible reference types or nullable
object is compatible with given type
The return type is a boolean					As operator returns the object when compatible else null 
-Is used for boxing, unboxing					used for nullable,reference and boxing

Equals() Vs ==

Both are used to compare two value type data or reference type data.
The == operator compares the reference identity, while the equals() method compares the contents

Async Await 
Await: a keyword that is used to suspend execution of the method until the awaited task is complete
